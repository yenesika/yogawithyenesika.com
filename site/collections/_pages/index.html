        Yoga is the ultimate pacifier for the stressors of the modern world. It is an all rounded tool meant for absolutely anyone and everyone that encourages physical, mental and spiritual well-being and growth.
        It brings a sense of tranquility that eventually turns into a way of life itself.

        “Yoga is the Journey of the self, through the self, to the self - The Bhagavad Gita”
