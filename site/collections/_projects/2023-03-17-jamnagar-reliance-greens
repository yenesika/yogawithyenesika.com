**Yoga with Yenesika at Reliance Greens, Jamnagar, Gujarat** 
Yenesika held a two-day team-building Yoga Workshop in March 2023, focusing on the health of the spine. As the backbone of our body, the spine bears extra weight to keep us upright. Especially with today's desk-bound routines, it's essential that we take good care of our spine. This workshop highlighted the importance of spinal health and provided attendees with practical Yoga techniques to ensure a healthier spine.
