**Yenesikaâ€™s Yoga gang in Noida** 
In March 2023, Yoga with Yenesika launched its flagship community building Yoga classes focused on the seven chakras at a picturesque farm in Noida. To commemorate International Women's Day, the Yoga Gang gathered for a transformative class, activating the Root Chakra or Mooldhara Chakra, which embodies safety - a crucial element for women's wellbeing. The class was followed by a delightful picnic, featuring a healthy meal lovingly prepared at home. The perfect end to an empowering and enriching day.
