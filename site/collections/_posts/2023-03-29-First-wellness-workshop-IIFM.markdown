I recently conducted a three-day long Yoga & Wellness Workshop at the **Indian Institute of Forest Management** in Bhopal, from 24th to 26th March 2023 where I had the opportunity to share my passion for Yoga and help participants explore the connection between mind, body and soul.

  

The workshop was attended by students, faculty, and staff, who came from diverse backgrounds and levels of experience with Yoga asana. Like every such workshop that I organise, I began by understanding their expectations and level of experience, and tailored the practices to suit their needs.

  

Over the course of the workshop, we explored various Yoga asana, pranayama or breathing techniques, and meditation practices that helped the participants relax, de-stress and cultivate a sense of inner peace. While all the classes were beginner friendly, the ones for students were intense **Ashtanga Yoga** classes whereas the asana classes for faculty and staff comprised of gentle body movements **inspired by Ashtanga Yoga to awaken the muscles to protect our joints**. We also discussed the benefits of these practices for overall well-being and how they can be incorporated into daily life.

  

One of the highlights of the workshop was the **interactive** nature of the sessions, where the participants were encouraged to ask questions and share their experiences. This helped foster a **sense of community** and support among the participants.

  

Overall, the Yoga & Wellness Workshop was a great success, and I am grateful for the opportunity to share my knowledge and experience with the participants. I was delighted to see that the workshop was covered by the print media in Bhopal. This was a particularly meaningful experience for me, as it was my first time being invited as a **guest faculty** to an educational institute of this stature. I am grateful for the recognition and the opportunity to share my knowledge and passion for Yoga with a wider audience.
